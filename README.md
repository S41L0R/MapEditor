Data is imported via files in Scripts/Loaders.  
Data is then prepped for cache storage via Scripts/Preppers if not gathered from cache originally.  
Data is then displayed or otherwise used by files in Scripts/Users
When the user decides to save their files, files in Scripts/Writers save the data to their drive in proper Wii U file formats.
